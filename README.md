# queue_as_dll
Final project for CS215: Queue as a doubly-linked list in C++

## Purpose
Demonstrates I can:
* create queue structuring using doubly-linked lists (DLL)
* implement class functions
* verify user inputs
* reuse written functions
* use pointers as private data members

## Problem to solve
Help a restaurant manager create a queue of customer orders. The orders must be fulfilled in the order they were received.

# What it looks like:
1. Prompts user to enter customer names, and enters them into a queue until user quits
2. Prints queue
3. Fulfills orders one at a time, each time printing the new customer cue
4. When all orders are fulfilled, declares "All orders have been fulfilled!"
